# CORE VERTICAL — Geophysics & Earth

This repository defines geophysical interpretation workflows for CORE.

It focuses on subsurface structure, material layering, conductivity, and coupling phenomena.

## Scope
- Subsurface interpretation
- Layered material visualization
- Water–rock–EM coupling analysis
- Geological anomaly mapping

## Non-Scope
- No drilling control
- No extraction systems
- No simulation engines
- No platform authority

## Architecture Position
Consumes outputs from LITHOS, HYDRA, MAGNETAR, ARES, and RGSR.

## Governance
Governed by CORE platform law.
Interpretation must remain non-destructive and non-extractive.
