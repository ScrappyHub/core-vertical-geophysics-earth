# CORE VERTICAL — Geophysics & Earth Systems

This repository defines the Geophysics & Earth vertical for CORE.

It is a **full-stack Earth physics platform** for subsurface,
environmental, and material interaction analysis.

## Physics Stack (Authoritative)

- LITHOS — layered geology & materials
- HYDRA — groundwater & fluid flow
- ARES — seismic & acoustic propagation
- THERMOS — geothermal gradients
- MAGNETAR — conductive & EM coupling
- SIGNAL — correlation & anomaly detection
- RGSR — multi-domain fusion

## Real-World Phenomena Modeled

- Earthquakes & fault activity
- Underground voids & tunnels
- Aquifers & groundwater flow
- Volcanic & geothermal systems
- Mineral & material layering
- Subsurface infrastructure

## What This Vertical Is

- A **scientific Earth systems platform**
- A **non-extractive geophysical analysis tool**
- A **risk and anomaly interpretation system**

## What This Vertical Is Not

- Not a drilling controller
- Not an extraction planner
- Not a predictive oracle

## Registries & Lenses

- Geological layer registries
- Material property libraries
- Seismic profile presets
- Environmental coupling models

## Governance

All outputs are interpretive.
No extraction or exploitation authority exists here.
